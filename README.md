# CozmoDeliveryBot
Cozmo will deliver one cube to another

Cozmo will light up cubes, then the robot will find the cubes.
Then the robot selects two colors and "delivers" one cube to another.
For example, "deliver" red to blue.
right now its cheating a little because it doesn't really recognize red, it knows that the 
cube 1 is red.
